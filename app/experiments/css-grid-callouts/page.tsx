          <h1>The Cinematography of <em>Citizen Kane</em>: A Visual Masterpiece</h1>
          <h2>Deep Focus: The Power of Composition</h2>
          <p>One of the defining features of <em>Citizen Kane</em> is its use of deep focus. This technique allows
            everything in the frame, from foreground to background, to remain in sharp focus simultaneously, giving the
            audience the ability to engage with multiple elements of the scene at once.</p>
          <figure>

              from the characters in the background to the furniture in the foreground, remains sharp and clear.

          <aside>
            <p>Toland was one of the first to master deep focus, often employing wide-angle lenses and extreme
              lighting to maintain clarity throughout the shot.</p>
          </aside>
          <p>By employing deep focus, Toland and Welles were able to direct the audience’s attention without using cuts
            or close-ups. In scenes like Kane’s childhood—where young Kane is playing outside while his future is
            discussed indoors—the technique emphasizes the emotional distance between the characters and the boy’s
            uncertain fate.</p>
          <h2>Low-Angle Shots: Power and Isolation</h2>
          <p>Welles and Toland often used low-angle shots to convey dominance and power. These angles make characters
            seem
            larger-than-life, towering over the viewer, and are notably used to reflect Kane’s growing ego and isolation
            as he gains power.</p>
          <figure>

          </figure>
          <aside>
            <p>To achieve these low-angle shots, Toland had to cut into the floor and place the camera at ground level, a
              rare and difficult technique at the time.</p>
          </aside>
          <p>One of the most famous low-angle shots occurs when Kane makes his triumphant political speech. The camera,
            looking up at Kane from below, showcases his command over the audience, but it also subtly suggests the
            arrogance that will lead to his downfall. The lighting further highlights this, casting shadows that hint at
            the darker aspects of his character.</p>
          <h2>Lighting: Chiaroscuro and Symbolism</h2>
          <p><em>Citizen Kane</em> makes extensive use of chiaroscuro, a lighting technique that employs strong
            contrasts
            between light and dark. This technique is frequently used to symbolize the duality within Kane—his public
            persona versus his private struggles.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://placehold.co/1600x800" alt="Chiaroscuro lighting in Kane"/>
            <figcaption>The use of shadows in this scene creates an eerie, mysterious atmosphere, highlighting
              the conflict within Kane.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <aside>
            <p>The chiaroscuro lighting style was heavily influenced by German Expressionism, which was known for its
              dramatic shadows and exaggerated visuals.</p>
          </aside>
          <p>In particular, scenes set in Xanadu, Kane’s vast and lonely mansion, are filled with heavy shadows and dim
            lighting. These scenes represent Kane's internal emptiness, despite his external success. The lighting
            creates an oppressive atmosphere, reflecting how Kane is ultimately consumed by his desires and
            loneliness.</p>
          <h2>Innovative Camera Movements: Fluidity and Exploration</h2>
          <p>The film is also renowned for its fluid camera movements, often achieved through intricate dolly shots and
            innovative transitions. Instead of relying on traditional cuts, Welles and Toland often used continuous
            tracking shots that moved through walls and ceilings, creating a sense of uninterrupted flow and an
            immersive
            viewing experience.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://placehold.co/1600x800" alt="Tracking shot in Citizen Kane"/>
            <figcaption>A famous tracking shot that seamlessly transitions through a neon sign, symbolizing the
              passage of time and changes in Kane’s life.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <aside>
            <p>These tracking shots were highly complex for the time, requiring the construction of elaborate sets that
              could accommodate the camera's movements.</p>
          </aside>
          <p>One of the most stunning examples of this technique is the breakfast montage between Kane and his first
            wife, Emily. The sequence begins with the couple in harmony and ends with them seated far apart, using long
            takes and camera movements to emphasize the growing emotional distance between them.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion: A Legacy of Visual Storytelling</h2>
          <p>The cinematography of <em>Citizen Kane</em> is a masterclass in visual storytelling. From its deep focus
            compositions to its symbolic use of lighting and innovative camera work, the film transformed cinematic
            techniques that have influenced filmmakers for decades. Gregg Toland's work on the film remains a testament
            to
            the power of cinematography to convey complex emotions and narratives, cementing <em>Citizen Kane</em> as a
            timeless masterpiece.</p>
