Think of how many times you have coded a grid of images with an overlay that appears on hover and displays some sort of text. With the `object-fit` property getting wider support, there is now a clean, semantic way to do this.

<SemanticImageExample />

## Without object-fit

Here’s how I used to accomplish this:

```html
<article class="blog-post-teaser">
  <div
    class="image"
    style="background-image: url(...)"
  ></div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <h2>
      <a href="...">
        Article Title
      </a>
    </h2>
  </div>
</article>
```

The markup involved an `article` containing a `div` with a background image applied, and an overlay `div` that contained the text that needed to sit on top of the image. I would then absolutely position both the image and the overlay. The size of the `div` would be determined by a percentage padding trick on the article:


```css
.blog-post-teaser {
  position: relative;
  padding: 30% 0;
}

.blog-post-teaser .image {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.blog-post-teaser .overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

The key downside with this approach is that it's not as semantic as it could be. The image for each article seems like a pretty important piece of content, and the browser doesn’t know that it’s an image. And we can’t feed in `alt` tags to help with SEO.

How do we improve semantics while retaining control of the image sizing? Enter `object-fit`.

## With object-fit

Here’s what my markup looks like now:

```html
<article class="blog-post-teaser">
  <figure>
    <img src="..." alt="...">
    <figcaption>
      <h2>
        <a href="...">
          Article Title
        </a>
      </h2>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</article>
```

Now the browser knows we’re serving up an image. It even knows that the article title is both a heading for the article and a caption for the image. Search engines can now access alt text. Let’s look at the styling:

```css
.blog-post-teaser figure {
  position: relative;
  padding: 30% 0;
}

.blog-post-teaser figcaption {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.blog-post-teaser img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

It’s almost identical, only that now we’re using the `img` element and applying the `object-fit` property. This works the exact same way as setting `background-size: cover`. The image will fill the specified space.

Now the browser knows we’re serving up an image. Search engines can properly access alternative text.
