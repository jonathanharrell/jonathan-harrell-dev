> One of the principles of durable typography is always legibility; another is something more than legibility: some earned or unearned interest that gives its living energy to the page. It takes various forms and goes by various names, including serenity, liveliness, laughter, grace and joy.

Welcome to this quick cheat sheet that will you help you know which spaces, punctuation, characters and numbers to use to make your web typography great! Much of this content has been adapted from Richard Rutter's excellent handbook [Web Typography](https://book.webtypography.net/).

## Use the right spaces

### Non-breaking space

![The text “Page 2” using a non-breaking space between the word and the number. The space is emphasized with a tall red rectangle and spacing marker.](/assets/illustrations/nbsp.svg "Prevents an awkward line break between closely related elements, such as labels and numbers.")

Use a non-breaking space to keep words together on the same line.

```html
Page&nbsp;2.
```

### Thin space

![The word “you” followed by a closing single and double quotation mark, with a thin space placed between them, highlighted in red.](/assets/illustrations/thin.svg "Maintains typographic rhythm by creating subtle breathing room where standard spacing feels excessive.")

Use a thin space to separate characters when a regular space is too big.

```html
Looking up he said, “She mouthed ‘I love you’&thinsp;” and then returned to his book.
```

### Hair space

![The initials “D. H. L.” spaced with thin hair spaces between each letter and period. Each space is marked with a dark vertical bar and a red spacing indicator.](/assets/illustrations/hair.svg "Adds just enough separation to avoid visual collisions between initials without disrupting flow.")

Use a hair space to prevent adjacent characters touching.

```html
D.&hairsp;H.&hairsp;Lawrence.
```

### Narrow no-break space

![The expression “1⁄2 em” with a narrow no-break space between the number and the unit, highlighted by a vertical block and measurement bar beneath it.](/assets/illustrations/narrow-no-break.svg "Keeps fine-grained units intact on a single line while preserving typographic tightness.")

Use a narrow no-break space to prevent initials or numbers and their units from wrapping across two lines.

```html
A hair space is 1/24&#8239;em wide.
```

## Use the right punctuation marks

### Hyphen

![The word “op–ed” shown with a hyphen between “op” and “ed” to illustrate compound word formation.](/assets/illustrations/hyphen.svg "A hyphen joins compound words without altering rhythm or spacing of surrounding characters.")

Use a hyphen for one of the following:
* joining words to indicate they have a combined meaning
* indicating missing words shared by a series of compounds
* indicating stuttering speech
* splitting words when breaking them across lines

*Example:* She wore a well-tailored jacket.

### En dash

![The numbers 4 and 5 separated by an en dash, demonstrating correct punctuation for numeric ranges.](/assets/illustrations/en-dash.svg "An en dash indicates range with spacing that visually balances the digits it connects.")

Use an en dash in phrases with numerical ranges.

*Example:* 4–5 minutes.

### Em dash

![The phrase “I—no” with an em dash between words, highlighting punctuation for interruptions or emphasis.](/assets/illustrations/em-dash.svg "The em dash marks interruption or emphasis—spaced just enough to breathe but not break.")

Use an em dash to set off phrases. Separate em dashes from phrases with hair spaces. You can also use to indicate attribution after a quote, followed by a full space.

*Example:* this and that — that and this.

### Minus symbol

![Two horizontal dashes side by side: a shorter hyphen labeled with a red “X,” and a longer minus sign labeled with a green checkmark.](/assets/illustrations/minus.svg "The minus symbol is longer and sits at the mathematical midpoint—unlike the shorter hyphen.")

Use a proper minus glyph to mean minus.

### Multiplication symbol

![The lowercase letter “x” on the left labeled as incorrect, contrasted with a typographic multiplication symbol on the right marked correct.](/assets/illustrations/multiplication.svg "A proper multiplication sign avoids confusion with the letter “x” and aligns better with numerals.")

Use a proper multiplication sign (not x).

### Obelus

![A slash symbol on the left marked incorrect and labeled “slash,” contrasted with a division sign (obelus) on the right marked correct.](/assets/illustrations/obelus.svg "The obelus is the correct symbol for division, with visual weight that centers between operands.")

Use an obelus to indicate division.

### Quotation marks & apostrophes

![Four straight vertical quote marks on the left labeled “straight marks” and marked with a red X. On the right, matching typographic curly quotes marked correct.](/assets/illustrations/quotes.svg "Quotation marks and apostrophes should curl inward and reflect the structure of the sentence—not the keyboard.")

![On the left: two straight vertical marks labeled “straight marks” and marked incorrect. On the right: typographic apostrophes with curled shapes marked correct.](/assets/illustrations/apostrophes.svg)

Use the proper quotation marks and apostrophes (not straight marks).

### Ellipsis

![Two sets of ellipses shown side by side: three individual dots on the left marked incorrect, and a single ellipsis character on the right marked correct.](/assets/illustrations/ellipsis.svg "The ellipsis character ensures consistent spacing and baseline alignment across typefaces.")

Always use the correct ellipsis character instead of typing three individual dots.

### Primes

![On the left, three straight vertical tick marks labeled “straight marks” and marked incorrect; on the right, slanted tick marks representing prime and double prime symbols are marked correct.](/assets/illustrations/primes.svg "Prime marks indicate units like inches and minutes; straight apostrophes are typographic imposters.")

Use primes to indicate feet and inches, minutes and seconds (not straight marks).

### Degree symbol

![A lowercase letter “o” on the left marked incorrect, contrasted with a correctly raised and smaller degree symbol on the right.](/assets/illustrations/degree.svg "The degree symbol is smaller and raised—distinct from a lowercase o.")

Use a proper degree symbol.

### Parentheses

![Two sets of parentheses compared side by side. On the left, the italicized version is marked incorrect; on the right, the roman version is marked correct, showing the preferred typographic form.](/assets/illustrations/parentheses.svg "Parentheses are not designed to be italicized; they retain proper shape and spacing when set in roman.")

Use for clarification or an aside. Don't italicize parentheses or brackets.
